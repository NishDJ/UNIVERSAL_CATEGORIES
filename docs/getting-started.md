# Getting Started

This guide will help you understand how to use and contribute to the Universal Categories repository.

## What Are Universal Categories?

Universal Categories are collections of related concepts that form a complete set within a given domain. For example, the "Periodic Table of Elements" is a universal category in chemistry, as it represents a complete and organized set of all elements.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by domains, with each domain containing multiple category files:

```
Categories/
├── Art/
├── Biology/
├── Chemistry/
├── Mathematics/
└── ... other domains
```

Each domain directory contains Markdown files that document specific categories.

## How to Navigate

You can navigate the categories in several ways:

1. **Browse the GitHub Repository**: Navigate through the directories to explore different domains and categories.
2. **Use the Documentation Site**: This documentation site provides a more structured way to browse categories.
3. **Clone Locally**: Clone the repository to your local machine for offline access.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/universal-categories.git
cd universal-categories
```

## How to Use a Category

Each category is documented in a Markdown file with a standardized format:

1. **Title and Description**: What the category is and why it's important
2. **Items**: The list of items in the category
3. **Properties**: Characteristic properties of the items
4. **Relationships**: How items relate to each other
5. **Examples and Applications**: Real-world examples and applications
6. **References**: Citations and further reading

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! To contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repository
2. **Create a New Branch**: Make your changes in a new branch
3. **Follow the Template**: Use `TEMPLATE.md` as a guide for formatting
