# Category Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for creating and maintaining categories in the Universal Categories repository.

## Principles for Good Categories

When creating or editing categories, follow these core principles:

1. **Completeness** - A category should represent a complete set of related items
2. **Coherence** - Items in a category should share common properties
3. **Distinctiveness** - Categories should be distinct from one another
4. **Clarity** - Category descriptions should be clear and accessible
5. **Accuracy** - Information should be factual and reliable
6. **Usefulness** - Categories should serve a practical purpose

## Content Quality Guidelines

### Research

- Conduct thorough research before creating a category
- Use reliable and authoritative sources
- Cross-check information across multiple sources
- Acknowledge areas of scholarly disagreement when relevant

### Writing

- Write clear, concise, and grammatically correct content
- Avoid jargon, or explain it when necessary
- Use objective and neutral language
- Structure content logically
- Define terms that may be unfamiliar to readers

### Citations

- Provide citations for factual claims
- Use a consistent citation format
- Include a diverse range of reliable sources
- Link to original sources when possible

## Category Selection Criteria

A good candidate for inclusion as a category should:

1. Represent a recognized classification system within a domain
2. Have distinct and identifiable members
3. Be supported by research or established practice
4. Possess definable properties
5. Have relationships to other categories or concepts
6. Serve a useful purpose in understanding or organizing knowledge

## Avoiding Problematic Categories

Avoid creating categories that:

- Are overly subjective or opinion-based
- Contain controversial or sensitive content without proper context
- Duplicate existing categories
- Are too narrow or specific
- Are too broad or vague
- Lack reliable sources or references

## Formatting and Structure

- Follow the [template structure](categories-template.md) exactly
- Use consistent Markdown formatting
- Include all required sections
- Use heading levels appropriately (# for title, ## for sections)
- Format lists, tables, and code blocks consistently

## Organizational Guidelines

### Domain Selection

- Place categories in the most appropriate domain directory
- Create new domain directories only when necessary
- Consider the logical organization of related categories

### Naming

- Use clear, descriptive names for categories
- Follow the [naming conventions](categories-structure.md#naming-conventions)
- Be consistent with terminology

### Cross-References

- Create meaningful connections between related categories
- Use relative links for cross-references
- Ensure links are accurate and up-to-date

## Review and Maintenance

- Review existing categories periodically
- Update outdated information
- Expand categories with new discoveries or developments
- Fix errors and improve clarity
- Respond to feedback from users
