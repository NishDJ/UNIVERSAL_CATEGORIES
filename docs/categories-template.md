### Items

This is the core of the category - the list of elements that compose it. For example:

- For "Literary Genres," these would be the different genres
- For "Architectural Styles," these would be the various styles

Each item should be numbered and can include a brief description if necessary.

- Distinguish items within the category
- Provide a framework for understanding the category
- Establish criteria for inclusion/exclusion

## Using the Template

When creating a new category file:

1. Copy the template from `Categories/TEMPLATE.md`
2. Fill in each section with relevant content
3. Maintain the heading structure (# for title, ## for sections)
4. Keep formatting consistent with other category files
5. Provide comprehensive but concise information

## Template Customization

While the basic structure should be maintained, some flexibility is allowed:

- Subsections can be added where appropriate (using ### level headings)
- Visual elements like tables or lists can be used to organize information
- Categories with special requirements may adapt the template slightly

The goal is to maintain a consistent format while effectively communicating the unique aspects of each category.
